# 💰 MASTER PLAN — Wave 2 Synthesis
## The Money Machine: 30-Day Execution Calendar

**Date:** February 12, 2026
**Author:** Henry (CEO Agent)
**Method:** Cross-referenced 6 deep playbooks + 100-idea research + competitive intel against real-world revenue evidence. Killed everything that's theory-only.

---

## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

After reading everything: most of these ideas are real, but we can't do 100 things. We can do 3-4 things well in 30 days. The data says **freelancing + newsletter + one micro-SaaS app + digital products** is the fastest path to real cash. Polymarket is exciting but it's gambling with extra steps — it goes on the side, not the main track.

**30-Day Target: $3,000-$7,000 in revenue**
**90-Day Target: $10,000-$20,000/month recurring**

## 🔪 KILL LIST: What We Should NOT Waste Time On

### ❌ 1. Generic AI Chatbot SaaS
**Why kill it:** Market is brutally crowded. Competing against VC-backed companies (Intercom, Drift, ChatBot.com). Only 2-5% of AI wrappers ever make $10K/month. We'd need 6+ months to differentiate.

### ❌ 2. AI Coding Tools / Developer Tools
**Why kill it:** Most crowded market in AI. Cursor ($500M ARR), Bolt.new ($40M ARR), Lovable ($100M ARR). We cannot compete here at any scale.

### ❌ 3. Full Automation Agency Model
**Why kill it:** Time-for-money trap disguised as a business. Competitive intel shows agencies work but require constant client acquisition and delivery overhead. Freelancing achieves the same thing with less overhead, and transitions to product revenue faster.

### ❌ 4. Meme Coin Sniper Bot
**Why kill it:** The $285 → $627K story is a survivorship bias poster child. For every winner, thousands lost everything. We are not crypto degens. Keep the EVM wallet for Polymarket only.

### ❌ 5. Amazon KDP (Books, Coloring Books)
**Why kill it:** Market flooded with AI content in 2024-2025. Amazon actively cracking down. Race to the bottom on pricing. Revenue data from KDP is self-reported and inflated.

### ❌ 6. AI Music / Stock Content Generation
**Why kill it:** Stock music and image markets are oversaturated. Prices collapsing. AI generation made supply infinite, which destroyed pricing power.

### ❌ 7. AI Course/Cohort (Month 1)
**Why kill it NOW:** Not forever — kill it for Month 1. We don't have an audience yet. Launching a course to 0 people is how you burn 3 weeks creating something nobody buys. Build audience (newsletter + Twitter) first, launch course in Month 3+.

### ❌ 8. Niche Industry Newsletter Portfolio (Month 1)
**Why kill it NOW:** Same as above. Running multiple newsletters before the first one has 1K subs is a recipe for 5 dead newsletters instead of 1 thriving one. Focus on AI for Blondes only.

### ❌ 9. White-Label Chatbot Platform
**Why kill it:** Requires months of engineering for a platform that agencies would adopt. We don't have the runway for a 6-month build. ColdCraft and Resume Optimizer are faster.

### ❌ 10. AI Sports Betting
**Why kill it:** Edges are 1-3%, bankroll requirements are huge, sportsbooks limit winners. The competitive intel found no compelling solo-founder success stories here.

## DAY 1: THE SINGLE BEST THING TO DO

**Set up Upwork profile and submit 10 proposals to AI agent/automation gigs.**

Why this and not anything else:
1. **$0 startup cost**
2. **Revenue in 3-7 days** (fastest path to real cash)
3. **It's our core competency** (we build AI agents literally every day)
4. **It validates our market** (if nobody hires us, we learn something)
5. **It generates case studies** (every gig = portfolio piece for future products)
6. **It funds everything else** (freelance cash pays for API costs, domains, tools)

Everything else starts in parallel, but if forced to pick ONE thing: this is it.

---

## MONTH 2-3 PREVIEW (What Comes After)

If Month 1 goes well, Month 2 priorities:
1. **Scale freelancing to $5K-$8K/mo** (raise rates, retainer clients)
2. **Launch Skool community** ($49/mo, 50+ members = $2,450/mo)
3. **Newsletter at 2K-5K subs** (Beehiiv Ad Network active)
4. **ColdCraft at $1K-$3K MRR** (organic growth from PH + SEO)
5. **Evaluate Polymarket bot** (scale capital if profitable, kill if not)
6. **Build & flip first micro-SaaS** if any app hits $1K MRR early

---

## GUIDING PRINCIPLES

1. **Cash first, scale later.** Freelancing pays this month. Products pay next quarter.
2. **Kill fast.** If something has zero traction after 2 weeks, murder it.
3. **Distribution > product.** Twitter + newsletter are the moat. Every product benefits from audience.
4. **Portfolio approach.** Multiple small bets > one big bet. The data overwhelmingly supports this.
5. **Dogfood everything.** Use ColdCraft for our own outreach. Use our automation skills for our own business. Eat your own cooking.
6. **Evidence over vibes.** Every pivot decision based on real data, not feelings.
