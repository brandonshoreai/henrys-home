# 🔪 Kill List — What NOT to Waste Time On

**Date:** February 12, 2026
**Source:** Master Plan Wave 2 Synthesis
**Rule:** If something has zero traction after 2 weeks, murder it.

---

## ❌ 1. Generic AI Chatbot SaaS
**Why kill it:** Market is brutally crowded. Competing against VC-backed companies (Intercom, Drift, ChatBot.com). Only 2-5% of AI wrappers ever make $10K/month. We'd need 6+ months to differentiate.

## ❌ 2. AI Coding Tools / Developer Tools
**Why kill it:** Most crowded market in AI. Cursor ($500M ARR), Bolt.new ($40M ARR), Lovable ($100M ARR). We cannot compete here at any scale.

## ❌ 3. Full Automation Agency Model
**Why kill it:** Time-for-money trap disguised as a business. Competitive intel shows agencies work but require constant client acquisition and delivery overhead. Freelancing achieves the same thing with less overhead, and transitions to product revenue faster.

## ❌ 4. Meme Coin Sniper Bot
**Why kill it:** The $285 → $627K story is a survivorship bias poster child. For every winner, thousands lost everything. We are not crypto degens. Keep the EVM wallet for Polymarket only.

## ❌ 5. Amazon KDP (Books, Coloring Books)
**Why kill it:** Market flooded with AI content in 2024-2025. Amazon actively cracking down. Race to the bottom on pricing. Revenue data from KDP is self-reported and inflated.

## ❌ 6. AI Music / Stock Content Generation
**Why kill it:** Stock music and image markets are oversaturated. Prices collapsing. AI generation made supply infinite, which destroyed pricing power.

## ❌ 7. AI Course/Cohort (Month 1)
**Why kill it NOW:** Not forever — kill it for Month 1. We don't have an audience yet. Launching a course to 0 people is how you burn 3 weeks creating something nobody buys. Build audience (newsletter + Twitter) first, launch course in Month 3+.

## ❌ 8. Niche Industry Newsletter Portfolio (Month 1)
**Why kill it NOW:** Same as above. Running multiple newsletters before the first one has 1K subs is a recipe for 5 dead newsletters instead of 1 thriving one. Focus on AI for Blondes only.

## ❌ 9. White-Label Chatbot Platform
**Why kill it:** Requires months of engineering for a platform that agencies would adopt. We don't have the runway for a 6-month build. ColdCraft and Resume Optimizer are faster.

## ❌ 10. AI Sports Betting
**Why kill it:** Edges are 1-3%, bankroll requirements are huge, sportsbooks limit winners. The competitive intel found no compelling solo-founder success stories here.

## The Principle

> **If it's not generating revenue or building audience in 2 weeks, kill it. No emotional attachment. Evidence over vibes.**
